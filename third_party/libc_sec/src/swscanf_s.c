/*
 * <FUNCTION DESCRIPTION>
 *    The  swscanf_s  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of the sscanf_s function
 *    The swscanf_s function reads data from buffer into the location given by
 *    each argument. Every argument must be a pointer to a variable with a type
 *    that corresponds to a type specifier in format. The format argument controls
 *    the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function
 *    as the format argument for the scanf function. If copying takes place between
 *    strings that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * <INPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    buffer                 Stored data.
 *    format                 Format control string, see Format Specifications.
 *    ...                    Optional arguments.
 *
 * <OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    ...                    the converted value stored in user assigned address
 *
 * <RETURN VALUE>
 *    Each of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted
 *    and assigned; The return value does not include fields that were read but not
 *    assigned.
 *    A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned.
 *    return -1 if an error occurs.
