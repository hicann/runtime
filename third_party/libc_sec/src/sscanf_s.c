/*
 * <FUNCTION DESCRIPTION>
 *    The sscanf_s function is equivalent to fscanf_s,
 *     except that input is obtained from a string (specified by the argument buffer) rather than from a stream
 *    The sscanf function reads data from buffer into the location given by each
 *    argument. Every argument must be a pointer to a variable with a type that
 *    corresponds to a type specifier in format. The format argument controls the
 *    interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as
 *    the format argument for the scanf function.
 *    If copying takes place between strings that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * <INPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    buffer                 Stored data.
 *    format                 Format control string, see Format Specifications.
 *    ...                    Optional arguments.
 *
 * <OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    ...                    The converted value stored in user assigned address
 *
 * <RETURN VALUE>
 *    Each of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted
 *    and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but
 *    not assigned.
 *    A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned.
 *    return -1 if an error occurs.
